            <h4>We are a italian restaurant located in Toronto, Ontario. Our story began with Marie
                Barone. She always had a dream in sharing her italian culture with the world. We strive to keep that dream alive, and 
                here we are 25 years later still going strong. Come by and try real authentic italian cuisine.
